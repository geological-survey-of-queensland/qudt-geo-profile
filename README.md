# Geo Profile of QUDT Ontology
This ontology is a profile of the [Quantities, Units, Dimensions & Types (QUDT)](http://qudt.org/) ontology that includes terms relevant to geoscience. In addition to term inclusion, this profile also created new collections containing the included units to list them in ways familiar to geo sceintists.

The profile elements are described using the [Profiles Vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/dx-prof/).
